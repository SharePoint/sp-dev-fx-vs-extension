## Question or Problem?
Please do not open GitHub issues for general support questions as the GitHub list should be used for feature requests and bug reports. This way we can more easily track actual issues or bugs from the code and keep the general discussion separate from the actual code.

If you have questions about how to use SharePoint Framework or any of the provided samples, please use the following locations.

* [SharePoint Developer Space](http://aka.ms/SPPnP-Community) at http://techcommunity.microsoft.com
* [SharePoint Stack Exchange](http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/) with 'spfx' tag

## Typos, Issues, Bugs and contributions
Whenever you are submitting any changes to the SharePoint repositories, please follow these recommendations.

* Always fork repository to your own account for applying modifications
* Do not combine multiple changes to one pull request, please submit for example any samples and documentation updates using seperate PRs
* If you are submitting multiple samples, please create specific PR for each of them
* If you are submitting typo or documentation fix, you can combine modifications to single PR where suitable
